# BPL_PlayerTypePriceOptimization

This project seeks to explore the frequent line-ups of successful & unsuccessful clubs constrained by finances. To investigate this problem, the researchers (1) built a game week over game week linear optimized model, (2) used actual club squad rosters, and conducted (3) dissimilarity analysis by drawing a network exhibiting the distance between maximized frequent itemsets and minimized itemsets.

The researchers clustered the players based on position, market value, & season points contributed; thus, appropriating a Gold, Silver, or Bronze tier to each player in a given season.
1. The researchers built a maximization & minimization model to build an optimal, budgetconstrained squad. Then, the researchers will conduct Apriori analysis on the maximization and minimized game week transactions.
2. Next, the researchers identified the top 25% and bottom 25% of teams in each season. Then, the researchers created squad transactions by identifying if a player played for a top or bottom club in the week. Then, the researchers conducted Apriori analysis on the top & worst teams in the season.
3. Lastly, the researchers drew a dissimilarity network between the maximized and minimized frequent itemsets.
